# Frontend Mentor - Social links profile solution

This is a solution to the [Social links profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). This challenge helped me improve my HTML and CSS layout skills by recreating a clean, responsive profile card.

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using :hover transitions for better interactivity

.social-links a:hover {
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 30%);
}

Convert this to a React component in the future

Deploy it as a mini portfolio contact section
